This is a Civil Engineering course project taken during Spring 2021 (6th semester).

1. Provided with the overall dimensions of the building and the surrounding topographical conditions.
2. Used STAAD Pro to assign the material properties and dimensions of components including columns, bracings, and purlins.
3. Applied various load combinations and iteratively achieved stability by making suitable modifications.
4. Used OSDAG to design the connections between components and AutoCAD to make the final structural design.
